## About Arezoo
I’m a 3D animator with a background in IT engineering, driven by a lifelong passion for art and storytelling. After completing my degree, I made a deliberate shift from technology to the creative world of animation.

My journey began with 2D character design, which soon led me to discover sculpting and 3D modeling through tools like ZBrush. This transition opened the door to the world of 3D animation, where I found my true calling.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across studios and freelance projects, contributing to a wide range of animation and cinematic productions—from stylized game characters to high-end VFX and storytelling for film and television.
